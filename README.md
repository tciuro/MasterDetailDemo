# MasterDetailDemo

This project demonstrates an issue that occurs on a standard Master-Detail project. The code is exactly what's shipping in Xcode 7. The only difference is the additional UITableViewController with a UISearchBar that I've added to demonstrate the problem.

### What's the problem?
Basically, the controller with the search bar will "jump" from the Master section to the Detail one after the device has been fully rotated.

#### Tapping on "One" shows:

#### Rotate to Portrait mode shows:

#### Rotate to Landscape shows:

### See the problem?
The controller with the search bar should be displayed in Master, but instead remains in the Detail section.

### [Solved]
Thanks to Richard Turton's [Understanding UISplitViewController](http://commandshift.co.uk/blog/2016/04/11/understanding-split-view-controller "Understanding UISplitViewController"), I found the answer:

    if let primaryNav = primaryViewController as? UINavigationController,
        secondaryNav = secondaryViewController as? UINavigationController {
        primaryNav.viewControllers = primaryNav.viewControllers + secondaryNav.viewControllers
        return true
    }
    
I suggest reading the whole article. It's excellent.

### Another issue! :-/
If the UI expands and the detail view controller "looses" the UINavigationItem, but not permanently. Once the UI is collapsed, the UINavigationItem appears again.

### [Solved]

Richard saved the day. The merge with the solution can be found here: [Rebuilt secondary navigation stack on expand](https://github.com/tciuro/MasterDetailDemo/pull/2 "Rebuilt secondary navigation stack on expand")

    func splitViewController(splitViewController: UISplitViewController, separateSecondaryViewControllerFromPrimaryViewController primaryViewController: UIViewController) -> UIViewController? {
        guard let
            primaryNav = primaryViewController as? UINavigationController,
            secondary = primaryNav.visibleViewController
            else { return nil }
        // Depending on your requirements you may need to remove more than just the top view controller.
        primaryNav.popViewControllerAnimated(false)
        return UINavigationController(rootViewController: secondary)
    }
